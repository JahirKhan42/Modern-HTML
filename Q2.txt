2. What are HTML Entities ? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities ?

Answer : HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML or characters that are not easily typable on a keyboard. These entities are 	especially useful when we want to display reserved characters, symbols, or characters that may have special rendering or encoding requirements in HTML. Here are 5 	commonly used HTML entities:

	1) < and > (Less Than and Greater Than):

	     &lt; represents the less-than symbol <.
	     &gt; represents the greater-than symbol >.
	     
	    Example:
	     <p>This is an example of &lt; and &gt; in HTML.</p>

	2) & (Ampersand):
	  
	    &amp; represents the ampersand character &.

	   Example:
	    <p>This is an &amp; example.</p>

	3) " (Double Quote):

	   &quot; represents the double quote character ".

	  Example:
	    p>This is a &quot;quote&quot; in HTML.</p>

	4) ' (Single Quote/Apostrophe):  
	
	   &apos; represents the single quote or apostrophe character '.

	  Example: 
	    <p>This is an example of an &apos;apostrophe&apos;.</p>

	5) (Non-Breaking Space):

	  &nbsp; represents a non-breaking space, which prevents the browser from breaking a line at that point.

	  Example:
	    <p>This is a non-breaking&nbsp;space.</p>
